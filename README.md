In a syntactic sense TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, so long as your JavaScript program doesn’t have any syntax errors then it is also a TypeScript program.<br>
It’s quite likely that TypeScript’s type checker will flag some issues with your code, TypeScript will still parse your code and emit JavaScript.<br>
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, this means that any valid JavaScript is automatically syntactically valid TypeScript.<br>
TypeScript brings object-oriented concepts such as classes and modules to JavaScript<br>
But TypeScript is so much more than a simple superset of JavaScript, because it adds some very useful functionality. <br>

TypeScript is four things:<br>

1) Programming language<br>
A language that includes all the existing JavaScript syntax, plus new TypeScript-specific syntax for defining and using types<br>

2) Type checker<br>
A program that takes in a set of files written in JavaScript and/or TypeScript, develops an understanding of all the constructs (variables, functions…​) created, and lets you know if it thinks anything is set up incorrectly<br>

3) Compiler<br>
A program that runs the type checker, reports any issues, then outputs the equivalent JavaScript code<br>

4) Language service<br>
A program that uses the type checker to tell editors such as VS Code how to provide helpful utilities to developers<br>
